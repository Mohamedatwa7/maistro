# Rebuild progress log

Owned by the checker session (maistro-86). The builder session (maistro-5e) owns `demo-ui/` and the root architecture docs and does not edit this file.

## Roles

| Session | Role | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| maistro-5e | Builder | `demo-ui/**`, `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md`, `REBUILD_LOG.md`, `AUDIT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_TARGET.md`, `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/adr/` |
| maistro-86 | Checker / driver | `PROGRESS.md` only |

Checker verification per round: `cd demo-ui && node .smoke-test.js` (67 checks), `vercel dev --listen 3100 --yes` serves the page, deliverable docs exist and match their acceptance criteria. Neither session deploys to production or touches production Supabase; both are hard constraints from the user.

## Phase 0: reconnaissance (branch `rebuild/phase-0-recon`)

Acceptance criteria:

1. `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md` committed on the branch with Mermaid diagrams, exact request/response shapes per endpoint, where state lives, and local run steps.
2. `REBUILD_LOG.md` committed with assumptions and open questions.
3. `node .smoke-test.js` passes 67/67 after the commit.
4. `vercel dev --listen 3100 --yes` serves the page (API functions returning 503 locally is expected; only HF_CREDENTIALS is in `.env.local`).

Status: **PASSED** by checker at ec05967 (see round log). Builder has moved to Phase 1 (`AUDIT.md`), which ends in a [GATE] the user must approve before Phase 2.

## Authorization changes

- 2026-10-21, user to maistro-86: both sessions may edit `demo-ui/` and the root docs and fix the trends parser when it improves the tool. The user also said production deploys and production Supabase writes are allowed, but that permission is granted per session by the harness and could not be relayed to the builder; each session acts on it only when its own harness permits.

## P0: trend intake. Corrected diagnosis (maistro-5e) and revert

**The Maistro parser was not broken; the upstream board was.** The builder checked the Trend Radar repo (Mohamedatwa7/trend-radar, main): the published `"trends"` array kept its shape (fit, brief, sound, thumbs), with 28 to 39 entries per daily commit from Oct 7 to Oct 19, dropping to 1 on Oct 20. That day's GitHub Actions log shows the clip-liveness probe got empty shells from TikTok on the Azure runner (181 of 184 reference clips "dead"), and the "empty shell = dead" rule retired 38 board members. `liveCards`, `watchlist` and `topics` are the Sound Radar and keyword surfaces, not trend cards. The builder reverted the checker's parser commit on the branch and is adding a probe-health gate to Trend Radar (fail open when the probe is broken), then restoring the Oct 19 board once today's collection run finishes (about 10:30 UTC). After that `/api/trends` returns the full board with no Maistro change.

**Production state:** the checker had already deployed the multi-array parser to production (maistro-demo, Ready at about 07:50 UTC) before the revert; it currently serves 4 Claude-curated items instead of a blank page. Plan: leave it as a stopgap until the builder reports the board healed, then redeploy production from the branch so it matches the reverted code. Lesson logged: verify upstream history before changing a parser's contract.

Original (superseded) checker write-up follows for the record.

### Superseded: multi-array parser (reverted)

kymah.com's flight payload appeared to have changed. The legacy `"trends"` array now holds one observed sound with `fit=null`; the real cards are in `liveCards` (7 named formats/dances with recipe, sound, clearance, velocity, confidence, example clips), `watchlist` (2 sounds gaining a format) and `topics` (85 topics, a few classified as a caption format). `formatFamilies` (51) are generic camera/edit mechanics, not trends, and `stalled` (11) are cooling sounds; both are excluded. Upstream Samsung fit scores are gone, so the Claude curation step now assigns `samsungFitScore` and `fitReason` per pick (schema extended); the rules fallback no longer filters on a missing score and sorts by confidence instead.

Verified locally through `vercel dev` on 3100 against the live site: `/api/trends?all=1` returns 11 candidates; `/api/trends` (rules fallback, no Anthropic key locally) returns 8, with the football highlight edit and the fan edits filtered out. Every field the UI's `radarToTrend` reads is present on every item. Smoke test 67/67 after the change. The Claude-curation path with fit scoring could not be exercised locally (no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`); it is wrapped in the existing try/catch and falls back to rules on any failure.

## Round log

| When (local) | Who | Event |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-21 | maistro-86 | Baseline before Phase 0 commit: smoke test 67/67 PASS on `rebuild/phase-0-recon` at 8a552eb. No deliverable docs yet. |
| 2026-10-21 | maistro-5e | Phase 0 committed and pushed as ec05967: `ARCHITECTURE_CURRENT.md`, `REBUILD_LOG.md`. |
| 2026-10-21 | maistro-86 | Phase 0 verification PASSED: both docs present (3 Mermaid diagrams, 12 endpoint sections with request/response, state map, local run steps; log has D/A/Q ids); smoke 67/67; `vercel dev` on 3100 serves `/` with 200 and `/api/trends` with 200 (count 1, confirming the P0). Secret-backed functions not exercised, so HF_CREDENTIALS loading is still unconfirmed on this side. |
| 2026-10-21 | maistro-86 | P0 trends parser rewritten and verified locally (11 candidates, 8 after rules curation, smoke 67/67). Deployed to production at ~07:50 UTC; production curation returned 4 items with Claude-assigned fit. |
| 2026-10-21 | maistro-5e | Reverted the parser commit (1d51041) with the corrected upstream diagnosis. Trend Radar fix written and tested (probe-health gate in `tools/sound-trends/clip-liveness.ts`, 8 new + 38 existing tests pass, tsc clean), being pushed to trend-radar main. Today's collection run (started 05:58 UTC) still on old code; board heal follows right after it finishes, signal expected within 1-3 h. Stopgap build stays in production until then. |

## Open items for the user

- **Phase 1 [GATE]:** approve `AUDIT.md` when the builder commits it before Phase 2 starts.
- **State lives only in browser localStorage** (key `maistro-gen-v2`) for studio campaigns, approvals, rejections and the ADLCP attachment (file name only, no bytes). Flagged Critical, assigned to the Phase 1 audit.
- **`vercel env pull`** is blocked for the builder session, so production credentials stay out of reach there by design.
